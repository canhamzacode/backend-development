# 🧠 Personal Journal for Backend Development

Welcome to my personal backend development journal! 🚀  
This repository is a collection of mini backend projects, each built with **TypeScript**, **Express**, and other helpful tools like **Zod**, **UUID**, and **ts-node**.

The purpose of this repo is to **learn**, **practice**, and **document** important backend concepts including:

- Error handling
- Input validation
- CRUD operations
- Middleware
- Authentication
- Testing
- Dockerization
- Deployment

Each project is located in its own folder under the `src` directory and includes documentation or comments explaining the thought process and what was learned.

## 📁 Projects

### 📦 `error-handling`

> A simple CRUD API for managing books with custom error handling using `Zod` and `Express`.

- Demonstrates:
  - Basic `Express` setup with TypeScript
  - Using `Zod` for input validation
  - UUID generation for IDs
  - Centralized error responses
  - Clean code separation and use of interfaces

---

## 📚 Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **Express**
- **Zod** – Schema validation
- **UUID** – For generating unique IDs
- **TSX** / `ts-node` – For running TypeScript files in dev

---

## 🛠️ Running the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
